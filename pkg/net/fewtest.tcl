# This file contains a Tk script which demonstrates a bug in the Tcl
# command [fileevent <socket> writable] on Windows 95/NT platforms
# for pre-8.0 versions of Tcl/Tk.
#
# Usage: wish fewtest.tcl ?port?
#
# When this script is evaluated by wish, it starts a server listening on
# the specified port (or port 25000 by default).  That server will 
# accept exactly one connection.  
#
# Connect to this server with some client (I use telnet).  When the
# connection is made, the client receives the message "Welcome message".
# After that, the server should provide a simple echo service.  At the 
# client end of the connection, the session should look something like:
#
# This is a test
# You said: This is a test
# testing 1 2 3
# You said: testing 1 2 3
#
# When the client closes the connection, this script will exit.
#
# While the server is running, its window displays two labels.  The first
# displays the queue of message to send to the client.  The second displays 
# the 'fileevent writable' event handler.  On a properly working system, 
# these labels just briefly flash their values between the time data is 
# placed on the queue and the time the writable file event causes the data 
# to be written and these values cleared.
#
# On Unix platforms, this script operates as expected.  However on 
# MS Windows 95/NT using wish42.exe, the [file writable] events 
# apparently don't get added to the event queue properly.  The Send
# proc is never invoked.  You can watch the putQueue grow and grow.
#
# Now the funny thing:  Click the mouse on the server window, and two
# messages in the putQueue will be serviced by the Send proc.  It's
# as if 1 mouse click event = 2 file writable events.  This behavior
# only occurs when the [grab .] near the bottom of this example script
# has been evaluated.
