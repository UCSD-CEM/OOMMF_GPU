# This file contains Tcl code which when sourced in a Tcl 8.1 interpreter
# will patch bugs in Tcl 8.1 fixed in later versions of Tcl.  It is not
# meant to be complete.  Bugs are patched here only as we discover the need
# to do so in writing other OOMMF software.

# Continue with bug patches for the next Tcl version
