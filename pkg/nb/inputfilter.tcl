Oc_Class Nb_InputFilter {
   # Each filter type variable (e.g., decompress) holds a list with an
   # even number of elements.  The first element of each pair is a list
   # of one or more file extensions, and the second element is a filter
   # command to run if the end of the input filename matches one of the
   # file extensions.  File extension matching is performed in order,
   # with the first match taking precedence.  After a filter is
   # applied, further matching is done against a reduced name formed by
   # removing the matched extension string, so for example, after
   # "foo.ovf.gz" is matched against ".gz", subsequent filtering will
   # use the string "foo.ovf" for filter extension matching.  For this
   # reason one should generally include the leading period ('.') in
   # the extension name.  However, if one wants to match say "foo.tgz"
   # against "gz", then both ".gz" and "gz" can be included in the file
   # extensions list.  But in this case the more restrictive match,
   # i.e., ".gz" should be earlier in the list.
