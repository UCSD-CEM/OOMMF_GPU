OOMMF DOCUMENTATION README

The documentation source files in this directory are LaTeX *.tex files,
using the LaTeX2HTML extension.  Version 98.2 beta 8 (or later?) of
LaTeX2HTML is required.  The latest development releases of 
latex2html are at <http://saftsack.fs.uni-bayreuth.de/%7Elatex2ht/>.

The 2000-02-09 version of these files has been built with LaTeX2HTML
versions 99.1 and 99.2.

The bibliography uses the osa.bst style file from the revtex3.1 package.

The application screenshots are captured against a white background that
is cropped to just hold the desired windows.  The program

xsetroot -solid White

can be used to change the X background color.  Use any of the colors
defined in rgb.txt (on Linux, this is in /usr/X11/lib/X11/), for
example, SteelBlue.

The screenshots are stored at natural size, with 8-bit color, in the
directories giffiles/ (GIF format) and pngfiles/ (PNG format), with
names of the form mmdatatable-ss.gif and mmdatatable-ss.png,
respectively ("ss" for "ScreenShot").  They are converted to
"compressed, reduced-color postscript" files at 200% resolution with
zero offset from the origin, and stored in the psfiles/ directory.  The
postscript files have the same base name as the source gif file, but are
given the *.ps extension.  Using "compressed postscript," the file size
is not affected strongly by resolution.  If along the processing chain
an "uncompressed" version is needed or results, and size is a problem,
the resolution can be cut to 100% without much loss of detail in the
printed version.  The GIF files are used in the document HTML output,
PNG files in the document PDF output, and the postscript files in the
document dvi/ps output.

The LaTeX command "\includepic" is defined in oommfhead.tex to simplify
graphics inclusion.  Example usage is

\includepic{mmdatatable-ss}{mmDataTable Screen Shot}

The first parameter is the graphics file
base name, expanded to "psfiles/#1.ps" under LaTeX, "pngfiles/#1.png
under pdfLaTeX, and "../giffiles/#1.gif" in the LaTeX2Html produced
*.html files.  The last parameter is a string for the ALT= tag in HTML.
At present, the last parameter is only used in the HTML code.

pdfLaTex (pdfTeX, Version 3.14159-0.12h (Web2C 7.2)) is sometimes
confused by the construct

             \section{Foo\label{bar}}
use
             \section{Foo}\label{bar}
instead.

The LaTeX packages "hyperref" and "html" both define \hyperref, and do
so in conflicting ways.  We want the html version, so use \hyperrefhtml
instead.

LaTeX and pdfLaTeX produce different .aux and .toc files.  LaTeX2HTML
doesn't seem to like the ones produced by pdfLaTeX, so it is important
to produce the .pdf, .ps, .html output in that order.
