\ssechead{Overview}
The application \app{mmLaunch} launches, monitors, and controls other 
\OOMMF\ applications.  It is the \OOMMF\ application which is
most closely connected to the account service directory and host
service directory applications that run behind the scenes.  It also
provides user interfaces\index{mmLaunch~user~interface}
to any applications, notably
\hyperrefhtml{\app{Oxsii}}{\app{Oxsii}
(Sec.~}{)}{sec:oxsii} and
\hyperrefhtml{\app{mmSolve2D}}{\app{mmSolve2D}
(Sec.~}{)}{sec:mmsolve2d}, that do not have their own user interface
window.

\ssechead{Launching}
\app{mmLaunch} should be launched using the \hyperrefhtml{bootstrap
application}{bootstrap application (Sec.~}{)}{sec:cll}.  The command
line is
\begin{verbatim}
tclsh oommf.tcl mmLaunch [standard options]
\end{verbatim}

\ssechead{Controls}
Upon startup, \app{mmLaunch} displays a panel of checkbuttons, one for
each host service directory\index{host~service~directory}
to which it is connected.  In the current
release of \OOMMF\ there is only one checkbutton---\btn{localhost}.
Future releases of \app{mmLaunch} will be able to connect to remote
hosts as well.  If there is no host service directory running on the
localhost when \app{mmLaunch} is launched,
\app{mmLaunch} will start one.  In that circumstance, there may be 
some delay before the \btn{localhost} check button appears.

Toggling the \btn{localhost} checkbutton toggles the display of an
interface to the host service directory.  The host service directory
interface consists of a row of checkbuttons, one for each account
service directory\index{account~service~directory}
registered with the host service directory.  Each
checkbutton is labeled with the user ID\index{user~ID}
of the corresponding account
service directory.  For most users, there will be only one
checkbutton, labeled with the user's own account ID, except on
\Windows~9X, where the dummy account ID 
``oommf''\index{platform!Windows!dummy~user~ID} may be displayed
instead.  If there is no account service directory running for the
account under which {\bf mmLaunch} was launched, \app{mmLaunch} will
start one.  In that circumstance, there may be some delay before the
account checkbutton appears.

\index{launch!with~mmLaunch|(}
Toggling an account checkbutton toggles the display of an interface
to the corresponding account service directory.  The account
service directory interface consists of two columns.  The 
\btn{Programs} column contains buttons labeled with the names of
\OOMMF\ applications that may be launched under the account managed by
this account service directory.  Clicking on one of these buttons
launches the corresponding application.  Only one click is needed,
though there will be some delay before the launched application
displays a window to the user.  Multiple clicks will launch multiple
copies of the application.  Note: The launching is actually handled by
the \hyperrefhtml{account service directory application}{account
service directory application (Sec.~}{)}{sec:arch}, which sets the
initial working directory\index{working~directory} to the
\OOMMF\ root directory.
\index{launch!with~mmLaunch|)}

The \btn{Threads}\index{threads}
column is a list of all the \OOMMF\ applications
currently running under the account that are registered with the
account service directory.  The list includes both the application
name and an ID number by which multiple copies of the same application
may be distinguished.  This ID number is also displayed in the title
bar of the corresponding application's user interface window.  When an
application exits, its entry is automatically removed from the Threads
list.

\index{mmLaunch~user~interface|(}
Any of the running applications that do not provide their own
interface window will be displayed in the \btn{Threads} list with a
checkbutton.  The checkbutton toggles the display of an interface
which \app{mmLaunch} provides on behalf of that application.  The only
\OOMMF\ applications currently using this service are
the 3D solvers \hyperrefhtml{\app{Oxsii} and \app{Boxsi}}{\app{Oxsii}
and \app{Boxsi} (Sec.~}{)}{sec:oxs},
the 2D solvers \hyperrefhtml{\app{mmSolve2D and
\app{batchsolve}}}{\app{mmSolve2D} and \app{batchsolve} (Sec.~}{)}{sec:mmsolve}, and the archive application
\hyperrefhtml{\app{mmArchive}}{\app{mmArchive} (Sec.~}{)}{sec:mmarchive}.
These interfaces are described in the documentation for the
corresponding applications.
\index{mmLaunch~user~interface|)}

The menu selection \btn{File\pipe Exit} terminates the \app{mmLaunch}
application, and the \btn{File\pipe Exit All OOMMF} selection terminates
all applications in the Threads list, and then exits \app{mmLaunch}.
The menu \btn{Help} provides the usual help facilities.
