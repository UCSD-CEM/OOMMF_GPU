<P>
Follow the instructions in the following sections, in order,
to prepare OOMMF software for use on your computer.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00032100000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="800"></A>
<BR>
Download
</H3>

<P>
The latest release of the OOMMF software may be retrieved from the
<A NAME="tex2html16"
  HREF="http://math.nist.gov/oommf/software.html">OOMMF download
page</A>.  Each release is
available in two formats.  The first format is a gzipped tar file
containing an archive of all the OOMMF source code.  The second format
is a <TT><B>.zip</B></TT> compressed archive containing source code and
pre-compiled executables for Microsoft Windows.  Each Windows binary
distribution is compatible with only a particular sequence of releases
of Tcl/Tk.  For example, a Windows binary release for Tcl/Tk 8.3.x
is compatible with Tcl/Tk 8.3.0, 8.3.1, ....  Other release
formats, e.g., pre-compiled executables for Microsoft
Windows&nbsp;NT running on a Compaq Alpha Systems RISC-based microprocessor
system, and/or compatible with older versions of Tcl/Tk, may be made
available upon request.

<P>
For the first format, unpack the distribution archive using gunzip and
tar:
<PRE>
gunzip -c oommf12a4_20040908.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</PRE>

<P>
For the other format(s), you will need a utility program to unpack the
<TT><B>.zip</B></TT> archive.  This program must preserve the directory structure
of the files in the archive, and it must be able to generate files with
names not limited to the old MSDOS 8.3 format.  Some very old
versions of the pkzip utility do not have these properties.  One utility
program which is known to work is
<A NAME="tex2html17"
  HREF="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html">UnZip</A>.

<P>
Using your utility, unpack the <TT><B>.zip</B></TT> archive, e.g.
<PRE>
unzip oommf12a4_20040908_84.zip
</PRE>

<P>
For either distribution format, the unpacking sequence creates a
subdirectory <TT><B>oommf</B></TT> which contains all the files and directories
of the OOMMF distribution.  If a subdirectory named <TT><B>oommf</B></TT>
already existed (say, from an earlier OOMMF release), then
files in the new distribution overwrite those of the same name already
on the disk.  Some care may be needed in that circumstance to be
sure that the resulting mix of files from an old and a new 
OOMMF distribution combine to create a working set of files.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00032200000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="815"></A>
<BR>
Check Your Platform Configuration
</H3>

<P>
After downloading and unpacking the OOMMF software distribution, all
the OOMMF software is contained in a subdirectory named <TT><B>oommf</B></TT>.
Start a command line interface (a shell on Unix, or the MS-DOS Prompt 
on Microsoft Windows), and change the 
working directory<A NAME="817"></A> to the 
directory <TT><B>oommf</B></TT>.  
Find the Tcl shell program installed as part of your Tcl/Tk 
installation.  In this manual we call the Tcl shell program
<TT><B>tclsh</B></TT>, but the actual name of the executable depends
on the release of Tcl/Tk and your platform type.  Consult
your Tcl/Tk documentation.

<P>
In the root directory of the OOMMF distribution is a file
named <TT><B>oommf.tcl</B></TT>.  It is the 
<A HREF="Command_Line_Launching.html#sec:cll">bootstrap application</A>
which is used to launch all OOMMF software.  With the command line
argument <TT>+platform</TT>, 
it will print a summary of your
platform configuration when it is evaluated by <TT><B>tclsh</B></TT>.
This summary describes your platform type, your C++ compiler,
and your Tcl/Tk installation.  As an example, 
here is the typical output on a Linux/x86_64 system:
<PRE>
$ tclsh8.4 oommf.tcl +platform
oommf.tcl 1.2.0.4  info:
OOMMF release 1.2.0.4

</PRE>

<P>
If <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> doesn't print a summary similar to the
above, it should instead print an error message describing why it can't.
For example, if your Tcl installation is older than release 7.5, the
error message will report that fact.  Follow the instructions provided
and repeat until <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> successfully prints a summary
of the platform configuration information.

<P>
<A NAME="831"></A>
The first line of the example summary reports that OOMMF recognizes
the platform by the name <TT>linux-x86_64</TT>.  OOMMF software recognizes many
of the more popular computing platforms, and assigns each a platform
name.  The platform name is used by OOMMF in index and configuration
files and to name directories so that a single OOMMF installation can
support multiple platform types.  If <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> reports
the platform name to be ``unknown'', then you will need to add some
configuration files to help OOMMF assign a name to your platform type,
and associate with that name some of the key features of your computer.
See the section on
<A HREF="Advanced_Installation.html#sec:platformNames">Managing OOMMF platform names</A>
for further instructions.
<A NAME="838"></A>

<P>
The second line reports the operating system version, which is mainly
useful to OOMMF developers when fielding bug reports.  The third line
reports what C++ compiler will be used to build OOMMF from its C++
source code.  If you downloaded an OOMMF release with pre-compiled
binaries for your platform, you may ignore this line.  Otherwise, if
this line reports ``none selected'', or if it reports a compiler other
than the one you wish to use, then you will need to tell OOMMF what
compiler to use.  To do that, you must edit the appropriate
configuration file for your platform.  Continuing the example above, one
would edit the file
<TT><B>config/platforms/linux-x86_64.tcl</B></TT><A NAME="840"></A>.
Editing instructions are contained within the file.  On other platforms
the name <TT><B>linux-x86_64</B></TT> in <TT><B>config/platforms/linux-x86_64.tcl</B></TT>
should be replaced with the platform name OOMMF reports for your
platform.  For example, on a 32-bit Windows machine using an x86
processor, the corresponding configuration file is
<TT><B>config/platforms/wintel.tcl</B></TT>.

<P>
<A NAME="844"></A>
The next group of lines describe the Tcl configuration OOMMF finds
on your platform.  The first couple of lines, ``tclsh (running)'',
describe the Tcl shell running the oommf.tcl script.  After that, the
``tclsh (OOMMF)'' subgroup describes the Tcl shell that OOMMF will
launch when it needs to run vanilla Tcl scripts.  If the OOMMF binaries
have been built, then there will also be a <TT>filtersh</TT> subgroup, which
describes the augmented Tcl shell used to run many of the
OOMMF support scripts.  All of these shells should report the same
version, bitness, and threading information.  If OOMMF can't find
<TT>tclsh</TT>, or if it finds the wrong one, you can correct this by
setting the environment variable
OOMMF_TCLSH<A NAME="847"></A> to the absolute
location of <TT>tclsh</TT>.  (For information about setting environment
variables, see your operating system documentation.)

<P>
Following the Tcl shell information, the <TT>tclConfig.sh</TT> lines
report the name of the configuration file installed as part of Tcl, if
any.  Conventional Tcl installations on Unix systems and within the
Cygwin environment<A NAME="850"></A> on
Windows have such a file, usually named <TT><B>tclConfig.sh</B></TT>.  The
Tcl configuration file records details about how Tcl was built and
where it was installed.  On Windows platforms, this information is
recorded in the
Windows registry<A NAME="852"></A>, so
it is normal to have <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> report ``none found''.  If
<TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> reports ``none found'', but you know that an
appropriate Tcl configuration file is present on your system, you can
tell OOMMF where to find the file by setting the environment variable
OOMMF_TCL_CONFIG<A NAME="855"></A> to
its absolute filename.  In unusual circumstances, OOMMF may find a
Tcl configuration file which doesn't correctly describe your
Tcl installation.  In that case, use the environment variable
OOMMF_TCL_CONFIG to instruct OOMMF to use a different file that you
specify, and, if necessary, edit that file to include a correct
description of your Tcl installation.

<P>
Next, the <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> reports similar information about the
<TT>wish</TT> and Tk configuration.  The environment variables
<TT>OOMMF_TK_CONFIG</TT><A NAME="859"></A>
and <TT>OOMMF_WISH</TT><A NAME="861"></A> may be
used to tell OOMMF where to find the Tk configuration file and the
<TT><B>wish</B></TT> program, respectively.

<P>
<A NAME="863"></A>
Following the Tk information are some lines reporting ``thread'' build
and run status. Threads are used by OOMMF to implement parallelism in
the Oxs (<TT>oxsii</TT> and <TT>boxsi</TT>) 3D solvers on
multi-processor/multi-core shared memory machines.  In order to build or
run a parallel version of OOMMF, you must have a thread-enabled version
of Tcl.  The Tcl thread status is indicated on the first thread
status line.  If Tcl is thread enabled, then the default OOMMF build
process will create a threaded version of OOMMF.  You can override this
behavior if you wish to build a non-parallel version of OOMMF by
editing the
<TT>oommf_threads</TT><A NAME="867"></A> value in
the <TT><B>config/platforms/</B></TT> file for your platform.

<P>
If Tcl and OOMMF threads are enabled, then the next line will show
the default number of threads run by the Oxs solvers.  (This value may
vary between machines, depending on the number of processors in the
machine.)  You can change this by setting the
<TT>thread_count</TT><A NAME="870"></A> value in
the <TT><B>config/platforms/</B></TT> file for your platform.  The default can be
overridden at run time by the environment variable
<TT>OOMMF_THREADS</TT><A NAME="873"></A>, or by
the <TT>oxsii</TT>/<TT>boxsi</TT> command line option <TT>-threads</TT>.  If
NUMA<A NAME="877"></A> support is possible on your platform (see
<A HREF="Advanced_Installation.html#sec:parallel">below</A>),
then the next line of thread info will indicate whether or not the build
process will create NUMA-aware Oxs solvers.
<A NAME="882"></A>

<P>
After the thread info, <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> reports the directory
that OOMMF will use to write temporary files<A NAME="884"></A>.
This directory is used, for example, to transfer magnetization data from
the micromagnetic solvers to the <B>mmDisp</B> display module.  You must
have write access to this directory.  If you don't like the
OOMMF default, you may change it via the
<TT>path_directory_temporary</TT><A NAME="887"></A>
setting in the <TT><B>config/platforms/</B></TT> file for your platform.  Or you
can set the environment variable
<TT>OOMMF_TEMP</TT><A NAME="890"></A>, which will
override all other settings.

<P>
If any environment variables relevant to OOMMF are set, then
<TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> will report these next, followed finally by any
warnings about possible problems with your Tcl/Tk installation, such
as if you are missing important header files.

<P>
If <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> indicates problems with your Tcl/Tk installation,
it may be easiest to re-install Tcl/Tk taking care to perform a
conventional installation.  OOMMF deals best with conventional
Tcl/Tk installations.  If you do not have the power to re-install
an existing broken Tcl/Tk installation (perhaps you are not
the sysadmin of your machine), you might still install your own
copy of Tcl/Tk in your own user space.  In that case, if your
private Tcl/Tk installation makes use of shared libraries,
take care that you do whatever is necessary on your platform to
be sure that your private <TT><B>tclsh</B></TT> and <TT><B>wish</B></TT> 
find and use your private
shared libraries instead of those from the system Tcl/Tk installation.
This might involve setting an environment variable (such as 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH<A NAME="895"></A>).
If you use a private Tcl/Tk installation, you also want to be sure
that there are no environment variables like 
TCL_LIBRARY<A NAME="896"></A>
or TK_LIBRARY<A NAME="897"></A>
that still refer to the system Tcl/Tk installation.
<A NAME="898"></A>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00032210000000000000">
Additional Configuration Issues on Windows</A>
</H4>

<P>
<A NAME="900"></A>
A few other configurations should be checked on Windows platforms.
<A NAME="901"></A>
First, note that absolute filenames on Windows makes use of the
backslash (<TT>&#92;</TT>) to separate directory names.  On Unix and
within Tcl the forward slash (<TT>/</TT>) is used to separate directory
names in an absolute filename.  In this manual we usually use the
Tcl convention of forward slash as separator.  In portions of the
manual pertaining only to MS Windows we use the backslash as
separator.  There may be instructions in this manual which do not
work exactly as written on Windows platforms.  You may need to
replace forward slashes with backward slashes in pathnames when
working on Windows.
<A NAME="902"></A>

<P>
<A NAME="903"></A>
OOMMF software needs networking support that recognizes
the host name <TT>localhost</TT>.  It may be necessary
to edit a file which records that <TT>localhost</TT> is a synonym
for the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).  If a file named <TT><B>hosts</B></TT>
exists in your system area (for example, <TT><B>C:<TT>&#92;</TT>Windows<TT>&#92;</TT>hosts</B></TT>),
be sure it includes an entry mapping 127.0.0.1 to <TT>localhost</TT>.
If no <TT><B>hosts</B></TT> file exists, but a <TT><B>hosts.sam</B></TT> file exists,
make a copy of <TT><B>hosts.sam</B></TT> with the name <TT><B>hosts</B></TT>, and edit
the copy to have the <TT><B>localhost</B></TT> entry.
<A NAME="914"></A>

<P>
The directory that holds the <TT><B>tclsh</B></TT> and <TT><B>wish</B></TT> programs also
holds several <TT><B>*.dll</B></TT> files that OOMMF software needs to find to
run properly.  Normally when the <A HREF="Command_Line_Launching.html#sec:cll">OOMMF bootstrap
  application</A> or
<A HREF="OOMMF_Launcher_Control_Inte.html#sec:mmlaunch"><B>mmLaunch</B></A> is
used to launch OOMMF programs, they take care of making sure the
necessary <TT><B>*.dll</B></TT> files can be found.  As an additional measure,
you might want to add the directory which holds the <TT><B>tclsh</B></TT> and
<TT><B>wish</B></TT> programs to the list of directories stored in the
PATH<A NAME="929"></A> environment variable.  All the
directories in the PATH are searched for <TT><B>*.dll</B></TT> files needed when
starting an executable.  <A NAME="931"></A>

<BR>
Compiling and Linking
</H3>

<P>
If you downloaded a distribution with pre-compiled executables, you may
skip this section.

<P>
When building OOMMF software from source code, be sure the C++
compiler reported by <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT> is properly configured.
In particular, if you are running on a Windows system, please read
carefully the notes in the
<A HREF="Platform_Specific_Installat.html#sec:install.windows">Advanced Installation</A> section pertaining to your
compiler.

<P>
The compiling and linking of the C++ portions of OOMMF software 
are guided by the application
<A HREF="Platform-Independent_Make_p.html#sec:pimake"
 NAME="945">pimake</A>
(``Platform Independent Make'') which 
is distributed as part of the OOMMF release.
To begin building OOMMF software with <TT><B>pimake</B></TT>, first change
your working directory<A NAME="947"></A>
to the root directory of the OOMMF distribution:
<PRE>
cd .../path/to/oommf
</PRE>

<P>
If you unpacked the new OOMMF release into a directory <TT><B>oommf</B></TT>
which contained an earlier OOMMF release, 
use <TT><B>pimake</B></TT> to build the target <TT>upgrade</TT>
to clear away any source code files which were 
in a former distribution but are not part of the latest distribution:
<PRE>
tclsh oommf.tcl pimake upgrade
</PRE>

<P>
Next, build the target <TT>distclean</TT> to clear away any old executables
and object files which are left behind from the compilation of the
previous distribution:
<PRE>
tclsh oommf.tcl pimake distclean
</PRE>

<P>
Next, to build all the OOMMF software, run <TT><B>pimake</B></TT> without
specifying a target:
<PRE>
tclsh oommf.tcl pimake
</PRE>
On some platforms, you cannot successfully compile OOMMF software if
there are OOMMF programs running.  Check that all OOMMF programs
have terminated (including those in the background) before trying to
compile and link OOMMF.

<P>
When <TT><B>pimake</B></TT> calls on a compiler or other software development
utility, the command line is printed, so that you may monitor the build
process.  
Assuming a proper configuration for your platform, <TT><B>pimake</B></TT> should be
able to compile and link all the OOMMF software without error.  If
<TT><B>pimake</B></TT> reports errors, please first consult 
<A HREF="Troubleshooting.html#sec:trouble">Troubleshooting</A>
to see if a fix is already documented.
If not, please send both the <EM>complete</EM> output 
from <TT><B>pimake</B></TT> and the output from <TT>oommf.tcl +platform</TT>
to the OOMMF developers when you e-mail to ask for help.
