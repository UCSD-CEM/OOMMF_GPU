\section{OOMMF Architecture Overview}\label{sec:arch}
\index{architecture}

Before describing each of the applications which comprise
the \OOMMF\ software, it is helpful to understand how these
applications work together.  \OOMMF\ is not structured as
a single program.  Instead it is a collection of programs,
each specializing in some task needed as part of a
micromagnetic simulation system.  An advantage of this modular
architecture is that each program may be improved or even replaced 
without a need to redesign the entire system.

The \OOMMF\  programs work together by providing services\index{services}
to one another.  
The programs communicate over Internet
(TCP/IP\index{TCP/IP}) connections,
even when the programs are running on a common host.  An advantage
of this design is that distributed operation of \OOMMF\ programs
over a networked collection of hosts is supported in the basic
design, and will be available in a future release.  

%Each \OOMMF\ application that provides a service to other applications
%contains a server which listens on a network port for service
%requests from other applications.

\index{client-server~architecture|(}
When two \OOMMF\ applications are in
the relationship that one is requesting a service from the other,
it is convenient to introduce some clarifying terminology.  Let
us refer to the application that is providing a service as
the ``server application\index{server}'' and the application requesting the
service as the ``client application\index{client}.''  
Note that a single application
can be both a server application in one service relationship and a 
client application in another service relationship.  
\index{client-server~architecture|)}

\index{account~service~directory|(}
Each server application provides its services on a particular
Internet port, and needs to inform potential client applications 
how to obtain its service.  Each client application needs to be able
to look up possible providers of the service it needs.  The
intermediary which brings server applications and client applications
together is another application called the 
``account service directory.''
There may be at most one account service directory application 
running under the user ID\index{user~ID} of each user account on a host.
Each account service directory keeps track of all the services provided
by \OOMMF\ server applications running under its user account on its
host and the corresponding Internet ports at which those services
may be obtained.
\OOMMF\ server applications register their services with
the corresponding account service directory application.  \OOMMF\
client applications look up service providers running under a 
particular user ID\index{user~ID} in the corresponding account server directory 
application.  
\index{account~service~directory|)}

\index{host~service~directory|(}
The account service directory applications simplify the problem
of matching servers and clients, but they do not completely solve
it.  \OOMMF\ applications still need a mechanism to find out how
to obtain the service of the account service directory!
Another application, called the ``host service directory'' serves
this function.  Only one copy of the host service directory application
runs on each host.  Its sole purpose is to tell \OOMMF\ applications
where to obtain the services of account service directories on that
host.  Because only one copy of this application runs per host,
it can provide its service on a well-known port which is
configured into the \OOMMF\ software.  By default, this is port 15136.
\OOMMF\ software can be 
\hyperrefhtml{customized}{customized (Sec.~}{)}{sec:custom}
\index{customize!host~server~port}
to use a different port number.
\index{host~service~directory|)}

\index{launch!by~account~service~directory|(}
The account service directory applications perform another task
as well.  They launch other programs under the user ID\index{user~ID} for which
they manage service registration.  The user controls the launching
of programs through the interface provided by the application
\hyperrefhtml{{\bf mmLaunch}}{{\bf mmLaunch} (See
Sec.~}{)}{sec:mmlaunch}, but it is the account service directory
application that actually spawns a subprocess for the new application.
Because of this architecture, most \OOMMF\ applications are launched
as child processes of an account service directory application.  These
child processes inherit their 
environment
from their parent account
service directory application, including their working directory, and
other key environment 
variables\index{environment~variables!inherited~from~parent~process}, 
such as {\tt DISPLAY}\index{environment~variables!DISPLAY}. 
Each account
service directory application sets its 
working directory\index{working~directory}
to the root
directory of the \OOMMF\ distribution.  Future releases of \OOMMF\
software will likely be based on a revised architecture which
alleviates these restrictions.

\index{account~service~directory!launching~of|(}
These service directory applications are vitally important to the
operation of the total \OOMMF\ micromagnetic simulation system.
However, it would be easy to overlook them.  They act entirely ``behind
the scenes'' without a user interface window.  Furthermore, they are
never launched by the user.  When any server application needs to
register its service, if it finds that these service directory
applications are not running, it launches new copies of them.  In this
way the user can be sure that if any \OOMMF\ server applications are
running, then so are the service directory applications needed to direct
clients to its service.  After all server applications terminate, and
there are no longer any services registered with a service directory
application, it terminates as well.  Similarly, when all service
directory applications terminate, the host service directory application
exits.

In the sections which follow, the \OOMMF\ applications are
described in terms of the services they provide and the services
they require.
