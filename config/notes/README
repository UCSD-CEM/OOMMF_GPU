This directory includes scripts and sample C programs that can be
used to diagnose configuration problems on some platforms.  They
are meant to be distributed so that when users report problems
configuring, building, or using OOMMF, we can make use of these
scripts and programs in our instructions on how to better diagnose
and correct the situation.

See documentation at the beginning of each file to learn what it
does.
