#The remainder of the file gives the labeling for each widgit and defines

#The data on the left of the colon in the above example is known as a
#mif entry.  The fields on the right of the colon can equal many things.
#For example, demag type can be set to 3dslab, 3dcharge, etc.
#Each thing that the mif entry can be changed to is called a choice.
#Note that some entries, such as ms, can only be set to one type of
#data so those entries will only have one choice defined.
#The format for the remainder of the file is:
#Number of Mif entries: a number equal the number of entries
#                        changed by menu e.g.: 5
# Data Change: defines the mif entry, e.g.: demag type, that is
#              changed by the widgit.
# Number of choices: Total number of data types that are defined for a
#              given mif entry.
# 0:the specification of the choice's properties. using the format
# number:choice name!command number!displayed label i.e.
# Choice Number:$title!widgit number (see above)!$label
# this structure repeats for all mif entries
