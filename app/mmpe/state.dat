# This file holds the mif file entries recognized by the problem editor.
# The problem editor will print entries based on the order of this file.
# For the problem editor to pass entries in a mif file  to the solver they
# must be added here.
# The number after the colon is the maximum number of entries allowed in
# the list used to hold the value of the mif field.  
# If mmpe is not going to edit this entry it can be set to 1.
