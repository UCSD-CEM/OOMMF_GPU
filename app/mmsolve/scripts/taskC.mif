# Anything on the same line and following a '#' character is a comment.
# Character case (upper or lower) does not matter.  If a parameter is

#Base Material Type:  permalloy
Ms= 80000e3
A=13e-12
K1=  0.5e3
Anisotropy Type:uniaxial     # One of <uniaxial|cubic>.
     
Anisotropy Dir1: 0 1 0    # Directional cosines wrt to coordinate axes
                     # (3 numbers). Optional; Default is "1 0 0"
#Anisotropy Dir2: 1 1 1    # Directional cosines wrt to coordinate axes
                     # (3 numbers). Optional; Default is "0 1 0"
                     #
                     # NOTE: For uniaxial materials it suffices to
                     # specify only "Anisotropy Dir1".  For cubic
                     # materials specify also "Anisotropy Dir2", and
                     # the third axis direction is calculated as the
                     # cross product of the first two.
                     #   The anisotropy directions will be automatically
                     # normalized if necessary, so for example "1 1 1"
                     # is valid input (it will be modified to
                     # ".5774 .5774 .5774").  For cubic materials,
                     # Dir2 will be adjusted to be perpendicular
                     # to Dir1 (by subtracting out the component
                     # parallel to Dir1).
